   Please understand that it's not an easy task and it may take time.
  :::
- fix(dl): the last CS2 major update broke the MM demo download feature, it's now fixed
- fix: CS2 executable may not be found on Linux since the last CS2 major update
- feat: the configuration folder location now follows the XDG Base Directory Specification on Linux
  :::warning

:::warning
If you encountered the issue [#735](https://github.com/akiver/cs-demo-manager/issues/735) with some of your demos, you
will have to clear the demos cache from the [settings](/docs/guides/database#optimizing-the-database) before analyzing
affected demos again!
:::

## v3.1.0

- feat(match): add a "**Duels**" tab with opening duels stats and an interactive map to find out where opening kills
  happened
- feat: add support for [FASTCUP](https://fastcup.net/) demos
- feat: add support for exporting players' voices from CS2 demos (it was possible only for CSGO demos).
  Thanks to [DandrewsDev](https://github.com/DandrewsDev) for his open-source [project](https://github.com/DandrewsDev/CS2VoiceData).
  :::danger  
   Valve Matchmaking demos (CS2 and CSGO) do not contain voice audio data hence there is nothing to extract from MM demos.  
   You can extract voices only from demos recorded from a server that includes voice data.
  :::

  It requires the `.dem` file on your filesystem otherwise you will have a "**Demo not found**" warning.

  [your own Steam API key](/docs/guides/settings#using-a-custom-steam-api-key) is still recommended.
