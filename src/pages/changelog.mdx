## v3.1.0

:::info
CS Demo Manager is a free and open-source software not backed by any corporate entity.  
You can support the project by [contributing](/docs/contributing) or [donating](/download/#donate).
:::

- feat(match): add a "**Duels**" tab with opening duels stats and an interactive map to find out where opening kills
  happened
- feat: add support for [FASTCUP](https://fastcup.net/) demos
- feat: add support for exporting players' voices from CS2 demos (it was possible only for CSGO demos).
  Thanks to [DandrewsDev](https://github.com/DandrewsDev) for his open-source [project](https://github.com/DandrewsDev/CS2VoiceData).
  :::danger  
   Valve Matchmaking demos (CS2 and CSGO) do not contain voice audio data hence there is nothing to extract from MM demos.  
   You can extract voices only from demos recorded from a server that includes voice data.
  :::
- feat: add "**Export players voice**" in the matches table context menu (it was possible only from the demos table).  
  It requires the `.dem` file on your filesystem otherwise you will have a "**Demo not found**" warning.
- feat: the application should now receive fewer rate limit errors from the Steam API, but using
  [your own Steam API key](/docs/guides/settings#using-a-custom-steam-api-key) is still recommended.
- feat(demos): add a checkbox to include subfolders for the current folder from the demos table
- feat(demo): avoid doing calls to the Steam API if possible when going to a demo page
- feat(video): turn off spellcheck in CFG input
- feat(ui): improve filtering menu layout
