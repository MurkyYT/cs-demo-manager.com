### \[ANALYZE\]

- POV demos are now analyzable with some [caveats](/docs/about#pov-support)
- Improve damage detection done by the "World"
- Shots in the neck are now detected
- Improve demos tickrate detection

### \[UI\]

- Add a combobox to filter demos by type (GOTV/POV)
- Add a menu to update demos type from the context menu
- Fix duration input in video view not visible on low screen resolution
- Fix possible crash when updading a demo's source
- Fix some typos

### \[GENERAL\]

- Add an option in the "Misc" tab to use a custom Steam API key.  
  Since the Steam API has a rate limit, it's recommended to use [your own key](/docs/suspects#steam-api-key).
  If you don't see players avatars or the suspects feature is not working properly it's probably because the rate limit of the key used by the app has been reached and so using your own key will fix it.

### \[WATCH\]

- A message asking to close any running anti-cheat software is now displayed when starting CSGO failed with an "access denied" exception

### \[EXPORT\]

- Enum values (example: round end reason) are now human readable in JSON export
