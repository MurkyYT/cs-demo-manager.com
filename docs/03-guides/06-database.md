## Optimizing the database

You can optimize the database (reduce disk usage, query timeâ€¦) from the application settings.

1. Go to the application settings
2. Go to the `Database` tab
3. Click on `Optimize database` button
   ![Optimize database](/img/documentation/guides/database/optimize.png)
4. Select what you want to do:
   - `Delete positions`: This will delete all positions used for the 2D viewer - It **strongly** reduces disk usage.
   - `Delete demos that are not on the filesystem anymore`: This will delete demos references **in the database only**
     known by the application that doesn't exist on the filesystem anymore.
5. Confirm and wait for the process to finish.
